                              This was were I first learnt to use for loops and if statements along with other basic fundamentals.
                              In matlab I learnt to create graphs using arrays as the data

                                For example this module improved my presentaton skills given several projects which required presenting to the class.
                                Improvements to CVs, cover letters and interview skills were improved and team work was essentialin most projects.

                                    For my dissertation I wanted to learn more about computing.
                                    So I studied the history of computers from the 17th century to today.
                                    More specifically computer architecture and its evolution through the years.
                                    The history of computers is very closely linked to mathematics as the word computer originally meant a mathematician (or someone who performs computations)

                          This module taught several key skills used in the buisness world.
                          Such as critical path analysis, the transportation simplex algorith and calculating stock.
                          This was a very useful module which taught alot about the buisness world.

                              First it taught the analysis of data on the more variable and testing a hypothesis.
                              Second the extraction of usuable data. This module stook with me as it introduced Rstudio.
                              A programming software that produced statistical output.

                                When it fails to run I love analysing it to spot the problem and coming up with a solution.

                            Working in a restaurant and voluntering at a charity shop I have developed keen communication skills.
                            In Picclino liverpool I worked with a team whose first language is Italian.
                            Here I learnt to speak clearly and to the point.
                            At the charity shop I dealt with customers and their problems and learned developed customer service skills.
                            I learned how to communicate in a professional manner and identify what exactly the customer wanted.

                              I've a lot of experience over the past few years giving presentatons.
                              The most notable was the presentation I gave for my dissertation.
                              I had to condense 13,000 words into a 3 minute presentation in front of the entire maths departemnt.
                              I kept the presentation under 3 minutes and the grade I recieved was a 1st.

                              My Duke of Edingburgh expedition is the best example of my leadership.
                              The team I was with was struggling to stay on time with the checkpoints and what route to take.
                              I took control directing which way to go and encouraged the team to press on.
