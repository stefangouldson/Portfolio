            <h2 class="sub-head">Why Coding?</h2>
            <p>
                Whilst studying at John Moores University, one of my modules was simple computer programming in Matlab. 
                It was always the module that stuck with me and I have always had an interest in coding. 
                My A levels show this having a C in Mathematics but earning a Distinction* in IT.
                I enjoy the challenges coding gives me and have grown addicted as I enjoy working on projects and research in my free time.
